  - text: Hey! How are you?
  utter_ml_def:
  - text: Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that
      provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience
      without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development
      of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
  utter_supervised_learning:
  - text: Supervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in
      the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Starting
      from the analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces
      an inferred function to make predictions about the output values. The system
      is able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training. The
      learning algorithm can also compare its output with the correct, intended output
      and find errors in order to modify the model accordingly.
  utter_unsupervised_learning:
  - text: unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used
      to train is neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how
      systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data.
      The system doesnt figure out the right output, but it explores the data and
      can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled
      data.

  utter_happy:
  - text: Great carry on!
  utter_goodbye:
  - text: Bye
  utter_reinforce_learning:
  - text: Reinforcement machine learning algorithms is a learning method that interacts
      with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial
      and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of
      reinforcement learning. This method allows machines and software agents to automatically
      determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize
      its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which
      action is best; this is known as the reinforcement signal.
  utter_bayes:
  - text: Bayes Theorem gives you the posterior probability of an event given what
      is known as prior knowledge. Mathematically, its expressed as the true positive
      rate of a condition sample divided by the sum of the false positive rate of
      the population and the true positive rate of a condition. Say you had a 60%
      chance of actually having the flu after a flu test, but out of people who had
      the flu, the test will be false 50% of the time, and the overall population
      only has a 5% chance of having the flu. Would you actually have a 60% chance
      of having the flu after having a positive test?
